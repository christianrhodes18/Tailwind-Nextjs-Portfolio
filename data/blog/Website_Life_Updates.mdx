Hi all, I just wanted to drop a quick update post here. I graduated university with a Bachelor's of Science degree in Computer Science this May. It was a good but long four years, and I am excited for the next chapter of my life. I am actively applying for software developer roles on the west coast of the U.S. I look forward to starting my first real job in tech!

After graduating, I spent the summer traveling to San Fransisco, Thailand, and Taiwan. I had an amazing summer with great people, experiencing wonderful new things everyday.

# Website Updates

First of all, the homepage has been updated. As you can see, the original home page was a big congested and also lacked content, which, yes, is as bad as it sounds. I decided to add some spacing to make things feel more spread out and balanced. I also added a header for the blog posts, since it was a bit random for them to appear on a short home page with little content.

Here is the added spacing and blog title:

Finally, I wanted to a better introduction section with left alignment. I also added cards to direct viewers to the most relevant pages. Here is the mock-update for that:

The final result feels a bit better and highlights the important pages for a personal website, which for me is my portfolio and about sections.

# Social Media and Designs Updates

I am making an effort to share my work more. I find the feedback valuable and I get a lot from belonging to communities with interests that I share. To this end, I've made a Behance, Dribbble, and Medium account, as well as a professional twitter to focus on development and design.

Here is a recent product card design I made for some UI/UX practice. One version has a price, and one does not.

# That's All!

I hope everyone is having a good summer and 2023 year! I will continue to work on this site and write blog posts related to web design and development. Cheers!
