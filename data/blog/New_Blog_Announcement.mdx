Hello again! I'm back for another quick update with what I've been up to in tech and blogging. For a long time now, I've wanted to run a blog site about my favorite media. There is so much content out there that is “worth-watching” for one reason or another. While I do my best to have a balance between creating and consuming (not-to-mention trying to manage a ‘normal' life that involves relationships, health, travel, etc.), FOMO can creep in alongside my ever-growing backlog. I've found that for me, writing about a certain piece of media I have recently experienced and enjoyed helps to cement that experience in my head. It's also fun to express relevant thoughts and feelings I have. I didn't make this blog to get numbers or push advertisements; it's purely a joy that I have the ability to create this platform, maintain it, and add content as I experience media that I love.

Some kinds of media I love and plan to write about include

- Music, especially metal
- Video games, from Nintendo fan favorites, to AAA Sony games, and cult classics like old Fire Emblem and Team Ico games
- Anime classics like Dragon Ball and Neon Genesis Evangelion, as well as great modern series like Attack on Titan, Chainsaw Man, Lycoris Recoil, and others
- Complex Films and TV like Aeon Flux, A24 films, and movies by directors including Christopher Nolan, Bong-Joon-ho, Stanley Kubrick, and more
- Fantasy and Sci-fi books, and history / geopolitical biographies and accounts

### Why the emphasis on aesthetics?

With so many blogs and online commentary around a given show or movie, I thought that having a specific basis helps provide something new to the reader, even if it's a small differentiation. Aesthetics tie into genres, but can be more lenient and representative of an overarching vibe that the director / author / composer / etc. may be putting forward. A show like Twin Peaks isn't necessarily drama, nor cult, nor simply sci-fi or mystery; it doesn't fit into a given genre without caveats. From the perspective of aesthetics, however, calling Twin Peaks _surrealist_ helps to capture the dreamlike and absurd elements that challenges the viewer's perception of reality. Sure, a term like **_surrealist_** is just a word, but I had a lot of fun compiling a list of aesthetics and trying to see if and how a piece of media's placement changes because of this distinction. So, instead of genres, I used **_media type_** and **_aesthetic_** to categorize media. Users can filter based on either of these specifications and might find things they like through this. Because there is so much great media vying for our attention, I hope that this blog can be used to develop and refine one's taste so that time is best spent on the right things.

Thanks you reading! I'll be updating the blog with both posts and features. I hope you enjoy.
