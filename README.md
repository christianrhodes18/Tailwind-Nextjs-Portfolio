# Tailwind Nextjs Portfolio

This is a personal developer portfolio website. Tailwind has made this site easy to style iteratively, and Next.js is a very powerful React framework that optimizes and streamlines much of the CD/CI and rendering of the process. 

This site was made with the help of the Tailwind Nextjs Starter Blog [Template](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/tailwind-css-starter-blog) from Vercel.
