I am a front end developer / software engineer interested in helping create the future of the web. I love working with the latest technologies that provide value and innovation to everyday users and the industry as a whole.

I am a 4th year computer science student looking to find a job contributing to a great technology company. I will be graduating May 2023.

In addition to being a full-time student, I am currently an independent contractor with Dappd, a Web3 SaaS company. I mainly do front-end work, producing websites from Figma designs provided by a client.

Some of my interests related to development include the web, UI / UX, AI and ML, AR and VR, and game development.
