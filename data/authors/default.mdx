I am a front end developer / software engineer interested in helping create the future of the web. I love working with the latest technologies that provide value and innovation to everyday users and the industry as a whole. 

I am currently a 4th year computer science student looking to find a job contributing to a great technology company. 

Some of my interests related to development include the web, UI / UX, AI and ML, AR and VR, and game development.
