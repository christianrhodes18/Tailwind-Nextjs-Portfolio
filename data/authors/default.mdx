I am a front end developer / software engineer interested in helping create the future of the web. I love working with the latest technologies that provide value and innovation to everyday users and the industry as a whole.

I recently received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of Vermont. Currently, I am a software developer at a startup software company based out of Deleware, and I do web development contract work on the side.

Some of my interests related to software development include the web, UI / UX, AI and ML, AR and VR, and game development.

I also run a media blog that I designed and developed where I write about my favorite video games, books, music, and more. Check it out at [Aesthete's Digest](https://aesthetesdigest.com/).
