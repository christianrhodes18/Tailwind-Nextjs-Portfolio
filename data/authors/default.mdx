I am a front end developer / software engineer interested in helping create the future of the web. I love working with the latest technologies that provide value and innovation to everyday users and the industry as a whole.

I recently received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of Vermont. Currently, I am an independent contractor with Dappd, a Web3 SaaS company. I am accepting contracts, part-time work, and willing to relocate for full-time work.

Some of my interests related to development include the web, UI / UX, AI and ML, AR and VR, and game development.
